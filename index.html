     <h3> Our mission </h3>

       <p1>
          We strive to bring awareness to air pollution and quality
         in St.Lucia. Clean air means better health. Help us keep our
         nation's air clean and clear. We organize recyclying,
         composting and bringng awareness one community at a time.
       </p1>
  <h4> Why we shouldn't burn waste </h4>
  <p2>
      Burning waste like tree branches and other forms of garbage releases
      toxic fumes into the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide (Co2) and nitrogen
    . These are called green house gases. And they're a reason.
    <br>
    These gases usually would be able to escape our atmosphere, but there is
    wayyy to much now! From factories, cars and burning of trash. That's just
    some sources. The trees cannot absorb so much co2 and it can't escape so it
    stays here in our atmosphere and creates that 'greenhouse' effect.
    <br>
    <br>
    Basically heating up the earth, it's oceans and us! The planet is being
    cooked!
